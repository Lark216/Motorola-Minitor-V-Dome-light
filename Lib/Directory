NeoPixel Library for CircuitPython
The NeoPixel library provides support for controlling RGB and RGBW NeoPixel (WS2812, SK6812, etc.) LEDs with CircuitPython. 
It allows you to easily set pixel colors, adjust brightness, and control strips or matrices of NeoPixels with minimal code.

You can import and use this library by placing the neopixel.mpy file into the lib folder on your CircuitPython device.
